![ I am an Electrical Engineer and a software developer in training](https://asociacionaepi.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/banner-aepi.jpg)

I am currently an occasional teacher in the Electrical Engineering program at UTP. I have participated in different consulting projects in studies of electrical power systems in distribution systems. In particular, I have participated in the area of â€‹â€‹algorithm programming that solves the problems raised in the projects. These codes were generally developed in the MATLAB programming language
I have also participated in projects related to the classification of information patterns using artificial intelligence algorithms such as neural networks using Python libraries.
I have also developed applications on the RAD Studio platform that uses Delphi language.
As a personal project I have developed some cell phone applications in the Android Studio language, which used to be Java.
I have also developed programming on the MetaTrader4 platform, which is a platform where you can view the graphs of the FOREX currency market.
Now I am looking for a remote job, where I can participate in projects that allow solving an engineering or software development problem.
